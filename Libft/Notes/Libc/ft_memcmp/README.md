## ft_memcmp
|DESCRIPTION|
|---|
|The memcmp() function compares the first n bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the memory areas s1 and s2.|

|RETURN VALUE|
|---|
|The  memcmp()  function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first n bytes of s1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first n bytes of s2.|
|For a nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair of bytes (interpreted as unsigned char) that differ in s1 and s2.|
|If n is zero, the return value is zero.|
